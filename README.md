# 🛡️ VirusDefense – 2D Tower Defense Graduation Project  
**Unity Project | Diploma Work | Tower Defense Gameplay**

## 🎮 Overview  
**VirusDefense** is a 2D tower defense game created as my final-year diploma project.  
In a world overrun by viruses, the player must strategically place medical buildings to protect people from incoming waves of virus attacks.  
Each virus has different stats (health, speed, etc.), and each defensive building uses unique themed projectiles like syringes, pills, and disinfectant shots.

🦠 *The idea for this game was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, which influenced the theme, enemy design, and overall message of the project.*

## 🧩 Features  

### 🧟 Enemy Waves (Viruses)  
- Multiple virus types with varying health, speed, and visuals  
- Progressive difficulty with each new wave  

### 🏥 Defensive Buildings  
- Place buildings like hospitals, pharmacies, and vaccine labs  
- Each building fires unique projectiles (syringes, pills, etc.)  
- Limited build spots for strategic challenge  

### 🎯 Projectile & Combat System  
- Themed projectile visuals  
- Collision-based damage logic  
- Enemy HP system with visual feedback  

### 📊 Game Progression  
- Wave-based system  
- Increasing challenge over waves  
- Game over and win conditions  

### 🔊 Sound & UI  
- Basic UI for health, wave count, and build options  
- Simple audio feedback (SFX & music-ready structure)
